operational requirements
    finished
        webserver always running whenever pi is on
        pump never runs with all valves closed (software logic)
        if multiple users edit state or schedule: last edit wins

    in progress:
        manually activated pump standard never runs for >1hr

    future:
        pump never runs with all valves closed (hardware circuit)
        pump never runs while webserver is dead
            (watch app heartbeat via cloud monitoring/alerting service?)
        pump and valves are distant from server
        pump switches off when minimum (0,5l/s) flow is not detected within 30 seconds
