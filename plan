operational requirements
    webserver always running whenever pi is on
    pump never runs while webserver is dead
    pump never runs with all valves closed
    pump switches off when minimum (0,5l/s) flow is not detected within 30 seconds
    manually activated pump standard never runs for >1hr
    pump and valves are distant from server
    if multiple users edit state or schedule: last write wins
